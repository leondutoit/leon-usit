### In general

* make eye contact
  * scan the audience continually
  * try talking to a specific person in the audience when you do make eye contact 
  * this will remind you that you have to make sense to real people and engage them in what you are saying
  * spot someone who is not looking at you, try to make eye contact with them
* be aware of your body language
  * don't turn your back on the audience (unless for a _very_ specific reason and for as short as possible)
  * don't put your hands in your pockets
* talk to the audience, not to your slides
* the fewer slides the better - the [most viewed TED talk](http://www.ted.com/talks/ken_robinson_says_schools_kill_creativity) ever has no slides
  * the fewer text you have on a slide the better
  * make do without slides if you can
* speak up
* do a test run with someone who does not know the topic
* silence is better than um-ing and ah-ing
  * I am thinking about English here
  * this can be difficult for native Norwegian speakers since pausing with sound is part of the spoken language
* arrive early to test the equipment
